The best way to do this is to collect \nAuthenticated ORCID iDs\n, which means that each researcher signs into their ORCID account and authorizes your system to obtain their iD. \nLearn more about Authenticated iDs\n\n\nRecord access permission\n\n\nControl over access to data in your ORCID record is one of \nORCID's core princples\n.

OAuth allows a user to give a website or application access to account information stored on another site, without giving that site their password. \n\n\nIf you've ever signed into a site using Google or Facebook instead of your credentials for that particular site, you've already used OAuth!\n\n\nThe OAuth process includes 3 steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate an authorization URL\n\n\nGet an authorization code\n\n\nExchange the authorization code for an access token\n\n\n\n\nGet API credentials\n\n\nAPI credentials consisting of a \nclient ID\n and a \nclient secret\n are needed in order to get Authenticated iDs and/or user permissions.\n\n\nTo get Authenticated iDs, you can use Public or Member API credentials. To get permission to read non-public information or add/update researchers' ORCID records, you'll need Member API credentials.
